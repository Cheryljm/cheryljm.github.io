                    Self-Care: Make sure to take care of your own physical and mental health. It’s important to be in a good place before the baby arrives.

                    Will and Guardianship: Update your will and consider who will be the legal guardian for your child in case something happens to you.
                    </p>
                    Practice Patience and Flexibility:
                    
                    Expect the Unexpected: Parenthood can be unpredictable. Be prepared to adapt and adjust as needed.
                    The most important thing is to be kind to yourself and your partner. Parenthood is a learning journey, and it's okay to seek help and make mistakes along the way.</p>

            <p>Toddlerhood is a time of incredible growth and development. While each child is unique and may reach milestones at their own pace, here are some general milestones to look for during the toddler years (typically ages 1 to 3):

                Kicking and Throwing: By 2 years, many can kick a ball and throw objects with some accuracy.
                Coordination: By age 3, they can jump with both feet off the ground and navigate stairs with alternating feet.
                Fine Motor Skills:
                
                Grasping and Manipulating Objects: Around 15 to 18 months, they can use a spoon or fork with increasing skill and manipulate small objects.

                Cognitive Development:
                Problem-Solving:
                
                Exploration: Toddlers explore their environment and start understanding cause and effect (e.g., pushing a toy car makes it move).
                Simple Puzzles: By age 2, they can solve simple puzzles and fit shapes into matching spaces.
                Language Development:
                
                First Words: By 12 to 15 months, many toddlers have a small vocabulary (around 5-10 words).

                Parallel Play: By age 2, they often play alongside other children (parallel play) rather than interacting directly.
                Emotional Expression:
                
                Expressing Feelings: Toddlers begin to express a range of emotions and might show frustration or anger more clearly.

                Self-Feeding: They develop the ability to feed themselves with utensils and drink from a cup.
                Toilet Training: Some children show readiness for potty training between 18 months and 3 years, but readiness varies.
                Remember, these milestones are general guidelines. Every child develops at their own rate, and a range of normal is perfectly okay. If you have concerns about your child's development, it’s always a good idea to consult with a pediatrician.

                <h2>The early days</h2>
                <h3>Read time: 10 minutes</h3>
            </header>
            <main>
            <p>The early days of parenting can be both magical and challenging. Here’s a guide to help you navigate those initial months with your newborn:

                1. Establishing Routines:
                Feeding: Newborns typically need to feed every 2-3 hours. Whether breastfeeding or formula feeding, try to establish a routine, but be flexible as your baby’s needs can change.
                Sleeping: Newborns sleep a lot, but in short stretches. Establish a consistent sleep environment and routine to help your baby differentiate between day and night.
                2. Understanding Newborn Needs:
                Feeding: Pay attention to hunger cues such as sucking on hands or rooting. Keep track of feeding times and amounts to ensure your baby is getting enough nourishment.
                Sleeping: Create a calm and safe sleep environment. Follow safe sleep practices like placing your baby on their back to sleep and using a firm mattress with no loose bedding.
                Comfort: Newborns often need comforting through swaddling, gentle rocking, or soothing sounds.
                3. Health and Wellness:
                Pediatric Visits: Schedule regular check-ups with your pediatrician to monitor your baby’s growth and address any health concerns.
                Immunizations: Follow the vaccination schedule provided by your healthcare provider to keep your baby protected from various diseases.
                Umbilical Cord Care: Keep the area clean and dry until it falls off, usually within a few weeks.
                4. Self-Care for Parents:
                Rest: Try to rest when your baby sleeps, as sleep deprivation can be a challenge in the early days.
                Nutrition: Eat well-balanced meals and stay hydrated. This is important for your energy levels and overall well-being.
                Support: Don’t hesitate to ask for help from family and friends. Share nighttime duties if possible, and accept offers for meals or household assistance.
                5. Bonding with Your Baby:
                Skin-to-Skin Contact: Spend time holding your baby close to strengthen your bond and help regulate their temperature.
                Talking and Singing: Talk to your baby and sing to them. This helps with emotional connection and early language development.
                Eye Contact and Smiles: Engage in eye contact and smile often. This fosters emotional bonding and helps your baby feel secure.
                6. Managing Common Challenges:
                Colic and Crying: It’s normal for babies to cry. Practice soothing techniques like swaddling, gentle rocking, or using a white noise machine. If crying persists or seems excessive, consult your pediatrician.
                Feeding Issues: If you have difficulties with breastfeeding or formula feeding, seek help from a lactation consultant or your healthcare provider.
                7. Preparing for the Future:
                Infant Care Basics: Learn the basics of infant care, including bathing, diapering, and umbilical cord care.
                Emergency Preparedness: Familiarize yourself with basic infant first aid and CPR. Have emergency numbers and a plan in place.
                8. Building a Routine:
                Daily Routine: Gradually establish a daily routine that works for both you and your baby. Consistency helps babies feel secure and understand what to expect.
                9. Emotional Well-being:
                Mental Health: Be mindful of your mental health. The early days can be overwhelming, and it’s important to seek support if you’re feeling anxious or depressed.
                Partner Support: Communicate openly with your partner about your needs and feelings. Parenting is a team effort, and supporting each other is crucial.
                10. Trust Your Instincts:
                Follow Your Gut: While advice is helpful, trust your instincts as a parent. You know your baby best, and your intuition is a valuable tool in caregiving.
                The early days are a time of adjustment for both you and your baby. Embrace the learning process, seek support when needed, and remember to take things one day at a time.</p>
